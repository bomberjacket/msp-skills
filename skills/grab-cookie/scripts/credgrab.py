"""credgrab - refresh browser-session credentials for sites with no API path.

Some vendors issue no API key and no OAuth for the surface an agent needs: the
web app authenticates with an httpOnly session cookie or an opaque token in
localStorage. That credential expires and must be re-captured by hand. credgrab
automates everything AROUND that one manual Copy-as-cURL step:

  extract (curlparse) -> store (OS credential store, credstore) ->
  wire (regenerate the tool's consumer file from the store) -> verify (live call)

The credential value never enters model-visible output: seed/wire print only a
redacted receipt (len / sha256[:8] / last4). The credential store is canonical;
consumer files (credentials.toml, .env) are DERIVED artifacts rebuilt from it
via each profile's template, so their exact format is always correct. A
mis-quoted or double-wrapped hand edit cannot recur, because the file is never
hand-written.

Commands:
  seed   --profile NAME [--curl FILE]   parse a capture -> store -> wire -> verify
  wire   --profile NAME                 rebuild the consumer file from the store
  verify --profile NAME                 run the profile's live health check
  doctor [--all | --profile NAME]       health-check; exit != 0 if any expired/expiring
  list                                  show profiles + last-seed + status
  --selfcheck [--live]                  curlparse + credstore + render tests. Offline by
                                        default; --live adds a real credential-store
                                        round trip (creates and deletes one entry, and
                                        can raise a Keychain prompt on macOS).

Profiles live in profiles/<name>.json; the two annotated example-*.json
files in that directory are the schema reference.
